    "### The `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` Idiom in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` idiom is a common pattern used in Python scripts to determine whether the script is being run directly or being imported as a module into another script.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `__name__` variable is a built-in variable that is automatically set to the name of the current module. When a Python script is run directly, the `__name__` variable is set to the string `__main__`. When the script is imported as a module into another script, the `__name__` variable is set to the name of the module.\n",
